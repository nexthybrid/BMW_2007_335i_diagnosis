# BMW_2007_335i_diagnosis
This is not code but a journal documenting car repair project. An early post about the car and condition can be found at [e90post](https://www.e90post.com/forums/showthread.php?p=25205416#post25205416).

# Symptoms
Large amount of white smoke comes out of exhaust pipes immediately after engine starts, with or without (most) coolant drained inside engine. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6KoIuUwy4o) for the smoke.

Some more details: when first dissembled, there was engine oil (black viscous liquid) inside the turbocharger air cooler (a.k.a. intercooler, FMIC), and inside the bottom of the engine air filter.

# Possible causes
A number of possible causes are collected from online comments:
1. Cylinder head gasket (CHG) leak
2. Oil filter housing gasket (OFHG) leak
3. Injector(s) failure
4. Turbo seals
5. Positive Crankcase Valve (PCV) stuck
6. Valve cover gasket (VCG) leak

# Process of finding/eliminating possible causes
- [ ] Opening up engine up to the CHG (can eliminate the cause of CHG leak)
- [x] Opening up oil filter housing (can eliminate OFHG leak)
  - [x] Need to first [remove the intake manifold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn6NVHLy-Xc)
- [ ] [Pulling the cats/ down pipes](https://www.e90post.com/forums/showthread.php?s=be053c282e0daa0ad45c68822f1ccb0a&t=1527240&page=2) and see if the turbos are wet inside (can eliminate turbo seals)

# Log of performed steps
1. 09.28 Removed intake manifold and OFH, the OFHG seems intact.
