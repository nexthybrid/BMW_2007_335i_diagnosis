# BMW_2007_335i_diagnosis
This is not code but a journal documenting car repair project. An early post about the car and condition can be found at [e90post](https://www.e90post.com/forums/showthread.php?p=25205416#post25205416).

# Symptoms
Large amount of white smoke comes out of exhaust pipes immediately after engine starts, with or without (most) coolant drained inside engine. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6KoIuUwy4o) for the smoke.

Some more details: when first dissembled, there was engine oil (black viscous liquid) inside the turbocharger air cooler (a.k.a. intercooler, FMIC), and inside the bottom of the engine air filter.

# Possible causes
A number of possible causes are collected from online comments:
1. Cylinder head gasket (CHG) leak
2. Oil filter housing gasket (OFHG) leak
3. Injector(s) failure
4. Turbo seals

# Process of finding/eliminating possible causes
- [ ] Opening up engine up to the CHG (can eliminate the cause of CHG leak)
- [ ] Opening up oil filter housing (can eliminate OFHG leak)
- [ ] Pulling the cats/ down pipes and see if the turbos are wet inside (can eliminate turbo seals)
